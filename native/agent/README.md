# Tiyo Rust

Tiyo is a compact terminal coding agent organized as six workspace layers.

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `engine` | Agent loop, canonical messages, tool lifecycle, sessions, project instructions |
| `services` | Provider registry and OpenAI-compatible, Responses, Anthropic, and Gemini adapters |
| `tools` | File reading/writing/editing, search, and shell execution |
| `security` | Workspace boundaries, access profiles, destructive-command policy |
| `ui` | Interactive terminal, non-interactive execution, model and session commands |
| `catalogs` | Built-in installable MCP and Skill catalogs |

Installed Skills are exposed to the agent through `list_skills` and
`read_skill`, so full instructions are loaded only when a task needs them.

## Provider configuration

Models are loaded exclusively from `~/.tiyo/config/providers.json` (or
`$TIYO_HOME/config/providers.json`). Both `model` and `fast_model` are exposed
by `tiyo models`; arbitrary model overrides are rejected.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "active": "my-provider",
  "providers": {
    "my-provider": {
      "type": "openai_compatible",
      "display": "My Provider",
      "api_key": "...",
      "base_url": "https://example.com/v1",
      "model": "main-model",
      "fast_model": "fast-model",
      "context_window": 256000,
      "effective_context_window_percent": 95,
      "auto_compact_scope": "total",
      "supports_web_search": false,
      "supports_vision": false
    }
  }
}
```

Supported provider types are `openai_compatible`, `openai_responses`,
`anthropic_messages`, and `gemini_native`. The legacy value `generic` maps to
`openai_compatible`.

Provider API keys remain plain text in `providers.json`. Settings masks them by
default and allows temporary reveal with `V`; it does not claim to encrypt the
file. OpenAI Responses providers can opt into trigger-based remote compaction with
`"supports_remote_compaction": true` and
`"remote_compaction_mode": "v2"`. Set the mode to `"legacy"` only for a
provider that implements `/responses/compact` instead of `compaction_trigger`.

## Context management

Tiyo uses provider usage as the context baseline and estimates local changes
incrementally. Tool calls remain paired with outputs, oversized outputs are
trimmed before old history, and real user
messages are retained around a compacted checkpoint. Context-window errors also
trigger one compaction and retry.

Automatic compaction is adaptive. Its default ceiling is 90% of the model's
declared context window, bounded by the effective context window and optionally
lowered by `auto_compact_token_limit`. It is therefore not a separate mechanism
that waits blindly for a UI meter to reach 90%. Use `body_after_prefix` for
providers whose reusable prefix should be excluded from the compaction counter.
Use `/compact` to run the same compactor immediately.

## Commands

```text
tiyo
tiyo exec "inspect this repository"
tiyo models
tiyo sessions
tiyo resume --last
tiyo compact --last
tiyo catalog list mcp
tiyo catalog list skill
tiyo catalog install mcp filesystem --set allowed_path=F:\Projects\Demo
tiyo catalog install skill frontend-design
```

Running `tiyo` or an interactive `tiyo resume` opens the full-screen terminal
interface. It keeps the conversation timeline, tool progress, queued follow-ups,
and multiline composer visible together. Use `Ctrl+K` for the command palette,
`Ctrl+R` for workspace session history, `Alt+M` for configured models, `Alt+S`
for Settings, and `Alt+H` for the complete key reference. `Alt+L` opens or edits
the active Loop, `Alt+Enter` starts a read-only Side Session, `Shift+Tab` cycles
the access policy, and `Esc` cancels an active turn. No F1-F12 binding is used.

Typing `/` opens the command picker. The main control commands are `/status`,
`/compact`, `/model`, `/history`, `/loop`, `/plan`, `/memory`, `/mcp`, `/skills`,
`/settings`, `/catalog`, `/new`, `/clear`, and `/quit`. Approval prompts and user
questions are bottom sheets directly above the composer, not centered dialogs.
Assistant output is rendered as Markdown, including headings, lists, tables,
links, code spans, and fenced code blocks. The footer shows active context usage.

## Runtime capabilities

The built-in tool surface includes `local_shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`,
`edit_file`, `apply_patch`, `list_dir`, `grep_files`, `web_search`, `view_image`,
`request_user_input`, `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, `close_agent`, and
`update_plan`, plus Loop, Memory, Skill, process, and configured MCP tools.
Provider-native web search replaces the local fallback when declared. Image tool
results use native multimodal content for Responses, Chat Completions, Anthropic,
and Gemini instead of placing Base64 in ordinary text.

Busy-turn input is accepted into the active model/tool loop at the next model or
tool boundary. Memory, Hooks, Side Sessions, automatic pasted Provider/MCP/Skill
configuration, startup update checks, installable catalogs, and keyboard-only
Settings are available in the first interactive session.

The default `workspace-write` policy allows file edits inside the selected
working directory and asks before arbitrary shell commands. `read-only` blocks
writes; `full-access` expands the path boundary but still asks before commands
recognized as destructive unless `--yes` is explicitly supplied.
